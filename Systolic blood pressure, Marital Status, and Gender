This project investigates the relationship between marriage status and systolic blood pressure (sysBP) using statistical analysis methods, primarily ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). The objective is to determine whether there is a significant difference in average systolic blood pressure among various marriage categories (Married, Divorced, Never Married, Widowed, and Other). We use a 99% Bonferroni-adjusted confidence interval to evaluate pairwise differences. The study is particularly relevant for understanding potential health impacts related to marriage.

The full dataset is called patientsW2017.csv, and has the following columns.
Column 1: The age of the patient.
Column 2: totalchol: A measure of the patients total cholesterol - the higher the number, the more cholesterol. In units of mg/dL.
Column 3: sysBP: The patients systolic blood pressure. In units of mm Hg.
Column 4: weight: The patients weight in units of kg.
Column 5: height: The patients height in units of cm.
Column 6: sedmins: The patients number of sedentary minutes per week.
Column 7: obese: The patients obesity category, with values normal, overweight, obese.
Column 8: marriage: The patients marriage category, with values other, married, divorced, widowed, nevermarried.
Column 9: gender: M or F, denoting Male or Female.

Summary of Findings
-Main Research Question: Does systolic blood pressure differ across marriage categories?
-Overall Mean sysBP: 125.1 mmHg
-Overall Standard Deviation: 18.85 mmHg

Marriage Categories' Mean sysBP:
-Widowed: 138.62 mmHg
-Married: 125.89 mmHg
-Divorced: 124.64 mmHg
-Other: 122.75 mmHg
-Never Married: 119.17 mmHg

ANOVA Result:
F-statistic: 16.09
P-value: 8.969e-13
Conclusion: Reject the null hypothesis; at least one marriage category has a significantly different systolic blood pressure.
Confidence Interval Insights:
Significant Differences: Widowed group has significantly higher systolic blood pressure compared to all other categories.
No Significant Differences: Between Married and Other, Divorced and Other, and several others where confidence intervals included zero.
Key Pairwise Comparisons:
Married vs. Never Married: Married individuals have higher systolic blood pressure.
Divorced vs. Widowed: Widowed individuals have significantly higher systolic blood pressure.

Assumption Testing
The main assumptions for ANOVA include:
-Random sampling from each group
-Independence between groups
-Normality of the populations
-Equality of population standard deviations
-Normality was violated:

-The Shapiro-Wilk Test yielded a p-value of 2.2e-16, leading us to reject the null hypothesis of normality.
-The Normal Q-Q Plot also showed heavy deviations, indicating non-normality.
Despite violations in normality, the analysis proceeded without adjusting for outliers.

Conclusion
-Overall Finding: Systolic blood pressure varies by marriage category, with widowed patients having significantly higher systolic blood pressure than all other groups.
-Practical Relevance: These findings are relevant for individuals considering the health impacts of marriage, particularly regarding cardiovascular health.
-Limitations: Normality assumption was violated, which might affect the robustness of the ANOVA results. Future studies could consider handling outliers or using more robust statistical methods.
